\begin{center}\textbf{Acknowledgements}\end{center}
	
I would like to express my special gratitude to Professor Carlos Baquero, for being my advisor and supporting my work with great advise and encouragement, through the last several months. Also a special thanks to Professors Paulo Sérgio Almeida and Vítor Fonte, both heavily involved in this project. Without forgetting Nuno Preguiça from \emph{Universidade Nova de Lisboa}, the consulter of this project. To all of them, thank you for the continuous support and encouragement throughout this work and for the counseling provided. I learned a lot. Without their guidance and dedication this dissertation would not have been possible.\\
Thanks to my colleagues and friends at the laboratory, for the pleasant environment created. Thanks to Pedro Gomes for the exchange of ideas and brainstorming that we often had. It was of great value.\\
Additionally, I am grateful to my family and Ana, for all the love and support given, and for always having confidence in me.\\
Finally, a special thanks to \emph{Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)} for supporting this work through project CASTOR (Causality Tracking for Optimistic Replication in Dynamic Distributed Systems), under Research Grant (BI) number: BI1-2010\_PTDC/EIA-EIA/104022/2008\_UMINHO
