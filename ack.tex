First, I would like to thank Professors Carlos Baquero and Rui José,
for being my advisers. Their support, knowledge and availability were
fundamental to the success of this work.

Also, a special thanks to Paulo Jesus and Miguel Borges, two colleagues
of mine from whom I've sought advice and help countless times.

To my long time friends, Pedro Gomes, Tiago Oliveira and Ricardo
Gonçalves for the motivation and unconditional support they have given
me.

To my friends from the
Distributed Systems Laboratory, Francisco Cruz, Francisco Maia, Miguel
Matos, Ana Nunes, João Paulo and Ricardo Vilaça. I have learned a lot
from them and will never forget the interesting discussions we've had.

Finally, to my parents, brother and sister, for their relentless
support, love and encouragement.
