        abstract = {Increasing research in ubiquitous computing techniques towards the development of an Ambient Intelligence raises issues regarding privacy. To gain the required data needed to enable application in this Ambient Intelligence to offer smart services to users, sensors will monitor users' behavior to fill personal context histories. Those context histories will be stored on database/information systems which we consider as honest: they can be trusted now, but might be subject to attacks in the future. Making this assumption implies that protecting context histories by means of access control might be not enough. To reduce the impact of possible attacks, we propose to use limited retention techniques. In our approach, we present applications a degraded set of data with a retention delay attached to it which matches both application requirements and users privacy wishes. Data degradation can be twofold: the accuracy of context data can be lowered such that the less privacy sensitive parts are retained, and context data can be transformed such that only particular abilities for application remain available.  Retention periods can be specified to trigger irreversible removal of the context data from the system.}

These scientists have demonstrated they can often 'reidentify' or 'deanonymize' individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease. By understanding this research, we will realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed. This mistake pervades nearly every information privacy law, regulation, and debate, yet regulators and legal scholars have paid it scant attention.
